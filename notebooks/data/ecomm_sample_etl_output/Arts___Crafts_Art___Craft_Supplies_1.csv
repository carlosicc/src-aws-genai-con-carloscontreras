Or just for the kids to have fun doing their cardmaking and scrapbooking. This glitter is perfect for glued glitter writing on all sorts of products should you wish to glitz up personalised gift bags for Christmas or even your party balloons. This glitter is also perfect for the glittering of glasses bottles etc as it contains no crushed glass and is fully certified for use in the UK. Colour awareness - due to screen resolutions/differences, the colours of the glitter seen may be slightly different from the actual colour delivered. For example the Copper colour we have is a very rich deep copper which is almost red. Please note that the colour fastness of the £11.99 glitter cannot be guaranteed if the glitter is left in suspension (glue etc) for long periods of time before use. The Pastel colours and other more expensive glitter colours are fully colourfast and can be left in adhesive suspension for long periods of time. If you are decorating glasses etc and sprinkling the glitter on then all these glitters will be suitable.","Five Stars // 5.0 // 21 Oct. 2015 // By
